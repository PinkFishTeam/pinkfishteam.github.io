description: In the frame of my PhD, I study a part of the carbon cycle. More specifically, I try to develop algorithms to infer carbon fluxes based on particle size distribution measured by in-situ instruments. For this, I needed to build a database of historical carbon fluxes measurements to validate my algorithms with real data. By creating an interactive dashboard, it helped me and my colleagues to visualize better where we were missing data instead of losing ourselves in tables from publications. It really helped to have both an horizontal view (latitude/longitude) and a vertical view (with reactive tables when the user clicks on a point in the map). In the end, it is going to be used as a reference for the European AtlantECO project on the Atlantic Ocean.
